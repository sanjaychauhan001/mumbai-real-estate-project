Project: Mumbai Flat Price Prediction and Recommendation

Objective: Developed a comprehensive model to predict flat prices and recommend flats in Mumbai based on user preferences.

Data Collection: Scraped data from Housing.com using Selenium and BeautifulSoup, the data was around 9500 after but after cleaning and outlier removal there was 7500 data points.

Data Cleaning: Utilized Pandas and NumPy in Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted univariate, bivariate, and exploratory data analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the dataset.

Feature Engineering & Selection: Performed feature engineering, outlier detection using Box plot, histogram, and IQR method. Applied statistical tests like ANOVA and tree algorithms to determine feature importance.

Modeling: Tested various algorithms and achieved the best results with Support Vector Regression (SVR). Optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

Flat Price Prediction: Predictive modeling to forecast flat prices.

Flat Recommendation: User-input-based recommendation system.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

Outcome: Developed a reliable model for predicting flat prices and a recommendation system to assist users in finding suitable flats.
